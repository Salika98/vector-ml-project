# Machine Learning Project for Vector.ai

## Part 1
If you would like to train the model on a different dataset and tweak parameters, what you need to do is change the fist two blocks of code after the imports and the rest should (hopefully) work.

## Part 2
Sendind and receiving messages with Apache Kafka. In order to test, run consumer_main.py and then producer_main.py
Implementation with Google Pub/Sub not attempted.

## Part 3
Combining part 1 and 2 to create a ml service using Kafka.
To test, run consumer_main.py and then producer_main.py
